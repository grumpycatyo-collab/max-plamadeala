## Warm-up

Hey, welcome to my little website. I've been really struggling to code it since I am not quite the frontend developer, however I really had fun doing it, and you know what? I might continue maintaining it 'cause it's been a very interesting journey overall.

As you might observe, I am a talkative individual so when you see me, don't hesitate to say `Hi!`. I'll respond in 90% of the cases, because the rest 10% I'll have my headphones on and won't typically hear anything.

I have a lot of interests but usually the things associated with me are `Hard-Worker`, `Gym` and `Engineering`.

## Actual description

I am currently a student at the Technical University of Moldova (`TUM`), pursuing a Bachelor of Science in `Software Engineering`, but also working at `Parkopedia` as a `Python Engineer`. I prefer to combine being easy-going with professionalism, because I want to love my work, but still not be burnt out.

Thanks for reading this improvised text, and if you want to contact me, in the header you can find the link to my LinkedIn.
